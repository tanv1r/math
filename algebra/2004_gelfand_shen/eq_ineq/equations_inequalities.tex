\section*{Problem-225}
\subsection*{Problem Statement}
If in the equation
\[
	ax^2 + bx + c = 0
\]
the coefficient $a$ is equal to zero then the equation takes the form
\[
	bx + c = 0
\]
and has the unique solution
\[
	x = -\frac{c}{b}
\]

Strictly speaking, the last sentence is wrong; when $b=0$ the quotient $\frac{c}{b}$ is undefined. How are we to correct this error?

\subsection*{Solution}
We should require that in the equation $ax^2+bx+c = 0$, both $a$ and $b$ cannot be zero.

\section*{Problem-227}
\subsection*{Problem Statement}
Prove that $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational.

\subsection*{Solution}
The statement `$\sqrt{3}$ is irrational' is equivalent to the statement that $\sqrt{3} \neq \frac{a}{b}$ for any integer $a$ and $b$. We shall make use of \textbf{proof by contradiction}, therefore, we shall assume that $\sqrt{3} = \frac{a}{b}$ and that should lead to a contradiction, completing the proof.

We shall consider four different cases for the pair $(a, b)$ and we shall derive a contradiction for each.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $a$ and $b$ both are odd integer. Say $a = 2m+1$ and $b = 2n+1$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers. According to our assumption
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{aligned}
		\sqrt{3} &= \frac{2m+1}{2n+1}\\
		3        &= \frac{ (2m+1)^2 }{ (2n+1)^2 }\\
		3\ (2n+1)^2 &= (2m+1)^2\\
		3\ (4n^2 + 4n + 1) &= 4m^2 + 4m + 1\\
		12n^2 + 12n + 3 &= 4m^2 + 4m + 1\\
		12n^2 + 12n + 2 &= 4m^2 + 4m\\
		6n^2 + 6n + 1 &= 2m^2 + 2m
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
On the left side we have an odd integer and on the right side we have an even integer---a contradiction. \contradiction

\item $a$ is an odd integer and $b$ is an even integer. Say $a = 2m+1$ and $b = 2n$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers. According to our assumption
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{aligned}
		\sqrt{3} &= \frac{ 2m+1 }{ 2n }\\
		3 &= \frac{ (2m+1)^2 }{ 4n^2 }\\
		12n^2 &= (2m+1)^2
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
On the left side we have an even integer and on the right side we have an odd integer---a contradiction. \contradiction

\item $a$ is an even integer and $b$ is an odd integer. Say $a = 2m$ and $b = 2n+1$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers. According to our assumption
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{aligned}
		\sqrt{3} &= \frac{ 2m }{ 2n+1 }\\
		3 &= \frac{ 4m^2 }{ (2n+1)^2 }\\
		3\ (2n+1)^2 &= 4m^2
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
On the left side we have an odd integer and on the right side we have an even integer---a contradiction. \contradiction

\item $a$ and $b$ both are even integer. In this case, $a$ and $b$ must have 2 as a common factor. We can divide both $a$ and $b$ by 2. We can keep dividing by 2 as long as both remain even integer. At the end, we are in one of the previous three cases.
\end{enumerate}
