\section*{Problem-225}
\subsection*{Problem Statement}
If in the equation
\[
	ax^2 + bx + c = 0
\]
the coefficient $a$ is equal to zero then the equation takes the form
\[
	bx + c = 0
\]
and has the unique solution
\[
	x = -\frac{c}{b}
\]

Strictly speaking, the last sentence is wrong; when $b=0$ the quotient $\frac{c}{b}$ is undefined. How are we to correct this error?

\subsection*{Solution}
We should require that in the equation $ax^2+bx+c = 0$, both $a$ and $b$ cannot be zero.
